# TO PLAY THE GAME: https://ctrl-alt-defend.itch.io/ctrl-alt-defend

# 🌟 Inspiration
Drawing from our very own experience with cyber frauds and difficulties navigating technologies, we believe creating a visual decision-making game can guide players through these hassles in a more fun and interactive manner!

# ⚙️ What it does
When starting the game, the player would take on the role of **CyberGod**, a tech genius who is using his knowledge to help out his friends who are experiencing all types of cybersecurity threats! You’ll take turns inspecting their problems, reading through their stories to collect context, and proceed to make informed decisions that would greatly affect the outcome of their security. We have 3 main characters with 3 different issues:

- ✏️ **Dylan** is a guy who reads webtoons on sketchy sites and gets pop-up ads bombarding his entire device! We need to stop these pop-ups by closing all those tabs on time! **Agility** but also **accuracy** is important to be on top of the game!
  
- ✏️ **Sherry** is a hard-working girl who’s applying to a lot of jobs and just received an offer from Google! But why is the sender’s address weird… Oh no! Sherry didn’t know and clicked on a link that infected her device with all these viruses! We need to defeat this virus by winning this mini-game! **React** and **predict**!

- ✏️ **Julie** is receiving a call from her bank saying her savings are at risk of losing and they need her information to recover it. Is this caller legit? What’s their caller’s id? Is this professional? Pick up cues from the phone call to help panicking Julie out!

Now doesn’t all of that sound exciting? Wait no more, grab your laptop and your brains, and let’s embark on this journey of helping your close friends out while also learning new things yourself!

# 📚 Journey Reflection
This is our first time being in a Hackathon, everything and everyone seemed so intimidating at first. We only met each other at the ceremony, not actually knowing what to do or how to do things. Yet, through effective communications and a blend of creativity and compsci, we managed to execute a fun mini-project that we can all feel proud of looking back at. In the process of making the game, we get to learn so much about each other, our skills complement one another, and we all bring in fun and cheeky ideas to make the game engaging and user-friendly! 

# 🛠️ How we built it
We built our program using:
RenPy, Python, Generative AI, and GitHub Copilot

## What's next for Ctrl + Alt + Defend
"Ctrl+Alt+Defend isn’t just a game—it’s a cybersecurity training tool. Whether for students, professionals, or businesses, our interactive experience makes online safety practical and fun. Moving forward, we aim to expand with more phishing scenarios, and more interactive mini games to keep cybersecurity awareness fun. Additionally, we hope to collaborate with cybersecurity educators and organizations to make online safety accessible and engaging."
